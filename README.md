# LineDetection-Tool
An implementation of the Hough Line Detection algorithm was created using the Dotnet wrapper of OpenCV. This tool can identify lines in an image by analyzing their slope and distance from the origin. The lines can then be grouped together based on their similarity in slope and distance, which can help extract intersections between them.
